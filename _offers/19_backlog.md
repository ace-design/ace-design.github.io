### Context

The main idea of agile-driven development (independently of methods such as SCRUM, Kanban, XP) is to continuously deliver value to the end-user. To perform such a task and specify the product to be developed, _software developers_ (SDs) and _product owners_ (POs) classically rely on the definition of user stories, organized in a product backlog.

In this project, we want to leverage backlogs (_e.g._, product backlog, sprint backlogs) to provide feedback to both SDs and POs for a given project. Natural language processing tools can be used to extract information from user stories (e.g., Visual Narrator). Based on the extracted data, it is possible to infer a _domain model_ (similar to an UML class diagram) for each story. this domain can be exploited to give useful information to SDs and POs, for example:

  - What happens if I decide to postpone this story to another one?
  - Why are all the stories related to this persona not addressed yet?
  - How does this sprint will cover the whole product?

The project follows the development of a _proof of concept_ that binds together VisualNarrator (an NLP tool to analyze stories) and Neo4J (a graph database). We want to go deeper in the analysis of the backlogs, by digging into realistic ones and leverage POs knowledge.
