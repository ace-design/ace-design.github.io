### Context

In the context of a large collaborative project involving a multi-disciplinary team in computer science and medicine, we are interested in creating mobile apps tailored to the privacy requirements of the final user. The _RELAI_ project (project selected in the context of the _New Frontier_ program supported by CRSH) aims to support mental health professional while diagnosing mental disorders. As the data needed to perform such a task are highly confidential and private, the used software must respect the level of consent expressed by the patient.

Thus, this MSc proposal aims to model and implement a software factory for android applications. Based on the business input given by the patient and the medical staff, the factory will select the right piece of software to assemble to build a dedicated application for this very patient, explicitly tracing how his/her privacy is respected in the process.
