The group welcomes five (!) new members! *Maxime* does his research project on source code merging, *Lou-Th√©o*  works on a domain-specific language to help the deployment of large-scale experiments on clusters (collaboration with A. Charpentier from the Maths department) and *Pierre* works on agile data visualization (collaboration with J. Privat). Last but not least, *Corinne* and *Rayan* will collaborate to the RELAI project (led by M.-J. Meurs) to define customisable data collectors.
