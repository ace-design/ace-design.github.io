Our paper entitled _Characterizing Black-box Composition Operators via Generated Tailored Benchmarks_ (Benni, Mosser, Acher and Paillart) is accepted for publication at the 16th European Conference on Modelling (Foundations and Applications). It is published in the Journal of Object Technology special issue associated to this conference. This work is a collaboration with the IRISA lab in Rennes, France, to support the characterization of composition operators.
