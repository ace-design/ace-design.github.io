Software variability studies the variation points and commonality that exists within a family of software products. In this context, the ACE group investigates how composition operators can be used to support additive and subtractive variability.

Typically, we are exploring how classical modeling techniques available in this context (_e.g._, feature models, feature-oriented programming) can be leveraged to emphasize the separation of concerns paradigm.
