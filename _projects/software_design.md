We are focusing here on the way software engineers develop piece of software.
Classical development ecosystems rely on version control systems (_e.g._, Git)
in an agile environment. We are interested in revisiting requirements
elicitation and bridging the gap between traditional requirements engineering
and modern software development (highly based on continuous integration and
tests), this tutorial will demonstrate how to  operationalize a fully-fledged
tool chain going from user stories to automated acceptance testing using
open-source tools.
